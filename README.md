## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

In chapter 2 visit the graveyard district and head over to 2584, 1117 or so. Observe that I should probably have been more ambitious.


Jury scoring:

>Our only veteran contestant serves the judges a dainty appetizer of a trick-or-treat tale, as one desperate Shadow Thief pulls one of the oldest tricks in the book to escape the predations of a hungry opponent. But were the judges satisfied by this morsel, or did they themselves feel cheated?

>*Chez Ding0 has been known for his unique synthesis of differing cuisine, and the theme seemed to be tailor-made for his style. However, the dish was disappointingly short and lacking in substance.* - CamDawg

>*Our chef provides a hastily prepared snack, which tells a story of how to use old tricks in combat. It's still better than any micro-waved frozen dinner, however, and maybe some day will see the Iron Ding0 serve a real meal. A feast to behold!* - SConrad

>*I always expect so much from this chef. SimDing0 is known for big flavors, and elaborate garnishes. This was somewhat of a disappointment, and left the table still hungry.* - MTS
